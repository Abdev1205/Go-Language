## Compiled Language in Go üöÄ

Go is a compiled language, which means that the source code is translated into machine code or an intermediate code before execution. This process is handled by a compiler, which analyzes the entire codebase and produces an executable file.

### Compilation Process

1. **Source Code**: You write your code in a high-level language like Go.

2. **Compilation**: The Go compiler (`go build`) translates the entire codebase into machine code or an intermediate format.

3. **Executable Output**: The compiler generates an executable file that can be run on a specific platform without the need for the original source code.

### Advantages of Compilation üõ†Ô∏è

- **Improved Performance**: Compiled languages often have better runtime performance as the code is optimized during compilation.

- **Portability**: Once compiled, the executable can be run on a target machine without requiring the source code or a separate runtime environment.

- **Early Error Detection**: Compilation catches errors before the program is executed, providing early feedback to developers.

### Example in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!") // This is Go source code

    // To compile: go build filename.go
    // The compiler translates this source code into machine code or an executable
}
```

Using a compiled language like Go ensures efficiency and platform independence.üë®‚Äçüíª‚ú®
