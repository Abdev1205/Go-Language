## Strongly Typed Language in Go 🛡️

In a strongly typed language like Go, the strict enforcement of data types is a key characteristic. This means that once a variable is declared with a certain type, it cannot be implicitly or automatically converted to another type without explicit casting.

### Example in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Strongly typed variables
    var count int = 42
    var ratio float64 = 3.14

    // Attempting to mix types results in a compilation error
    // var result = count + ratio // Uncommenting this line will cause a compilation error

    // Explicit type conversion is required for operations involving different types
    result := float64(count) + ratio

    // Print result
    fmt.Printf("Result: %.2f\n", result)
}
```

In this example:

- `count` is explicitly declared as an `int`.
- `ratio` is explicitly declared as a `float64`.
- Attempting to perform an operation (uncommented line) directly with different types results in a compilation error.
- To perform the operation, explicit type conversion is required.

### Advantages of Strongly Typed Languages

- **Prevents Type-related Bugs**: Enforces strict typing, reducing the chances of type-related errors.
- **Code Clarity**: Type declarations make code more readable and self-documenting.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Compiler optimizations benefit from knowing the exact data types.

Using Go's strong typing ensures code integrity and reliability throughout the development process. 👨‍💻🚀
